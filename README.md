# Timetable Project Using Genetic Algorithm

## Status: Developing....

## Introduction
This project is a Time Table Management System that uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize scheduling. The genetic algorithm efficiently resolves conflicts, such as overlapping classes or unavailability of resources, ensuring a fair and feasible timetable.

## Features
Conflict-free scheduling of classes.
Dynamic handling of constraints (e.g., instructor availability, room capacity).
Optimized schedules based on predefined fitness criteria.
Easy customization for institutions of different scales.
